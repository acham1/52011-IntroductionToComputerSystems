Project 6: Assembler
README.txt

I.  Compiling
    The source code consists of a single .java file.
    First navigate the current working directory to ChamAlanProject6/src/
    Then compile as follows:

    javac Assembler.java

    This should produce a new file Assembler.class in ChamAlanProject6/src/

II. Running
    To run the code after compiling, navigate the current working directory 
    to ChamAlanProject6/src/

    java Assembler xxx.asm

    xxx.asm is the file to be assembled. The output will be xxx.hack in the same
    directory as xxx.asm. xxx may be a simple filename if the file is in the 
    current working directory; otherwise it may be an absolute or relative pathname.

III.Things that Don't Work
    This program has been verified to work as far as the dry tests are concerned.
